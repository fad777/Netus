1.) Click on the nature node (oval) button on toolbar, right click and click properties. A dialog box opens up, add somes states and 
change the name of the node.

2.) Right click on nature node again, and click CPTable, enter some probability values which would equal 1.0

3.) Now, click on decision node(rectangle) button on toolbar, right click and click properties. A dialog box opens up, add some states 
and change the name of the node.

4.) Right click on decision node again, and click CPTable, enter some probability values. These are temporary and will be updated when you link the nodes

5.) Click on link node button (arrow) on toolbar, right click and click properties. Set the parent (nature node) and child (decision node) 
and click on Make link button

6.) Now, right click on decision nodes, and click CPTable, a 2D table appears, fill the table with probability values but each row should equal 1.0

7.) Right click on nature node, click enter finding. Select a state. 

8.) Now right click on decision nodes, click getUtils, it displays a message showing the best decision and a table showing the conditional 
probabilities of possible decisions states


**Utility Node still doesn't do anything but when you right click on decision node and click on getUtils(), it gives you the best decision and also 
	gives the utility table. I couldn't figure out how to do it on the utility node

** It only works when there is one nature node and one decision node. It doesn't read it when there are two nature nodes and the second nature node is 
connected to the decision node. I have been trying to fix it but I don't have a lot of time.

**I hope this is ok.

**I am also attaching screenshots

untitled = shows the influence diagram with the best decision

untitled2 = shows the utility table
